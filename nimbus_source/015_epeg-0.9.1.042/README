Epeg 0.9.0

What is Epeg?

An IMMENSELY FAST JPEG thumbnailer library API.

Why write this? It's a convenience library API to using libjpeg to load JPEG
images destined to be turned into thumbnails of the original, saving
information with these thumbnails, retreiving it and managing to load the image
ready for scaling with the minimum of fuss and CPU overhead.

This means it's insanely fast at loading large JPEG images and scaling them
down to tiny thumbnails. It's speedup will be proportional to the size
difference between the source image and the output thumbnail size as a
count of their pixels.

It makes use of libjpeg features of being able to load an image by only
decoding the DCT coefficients needed to reconstruct an image of the size
desired. This gives a massive speedup. If you do not try and access the pixels
in a format other than YUV (or GRAY8 if the source is grascale) then it also
avoids colorspace conversions as well.

Please see the full documentation for Epeg for more details.
