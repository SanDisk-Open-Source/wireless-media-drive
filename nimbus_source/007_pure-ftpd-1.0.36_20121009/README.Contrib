includes a wizard to easily set up your server, Rendezvous support to
publish your server efficiently, and groovy interfaces for virtual users and
hosts management.


* PureAdmin
http://purify.sourceforge.net/

PureAdmin is a graphical tool used to make the management of PureFTPd a
little easier. It is not dependent on a specific desktop environment such as
GNOME or KDE, but is designed with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines in
mind.

ppum (PureFTPD PHP User Manager) is a PureFTPD PHP User Management System
designed for an easy Web-based administration of SQL stored and
authenticated FTP users.


* User manager for Pure-FTPd
http://machiel.generaal.net/index.php?subject=user_manager_pureftpd

User manager for PureFTPd allows administrators to easily create, change, or
delete 'virtual' PureFTPd users. It comes with a set of very good
documentation to help with the setup of PureFTPd, MySQL, and this application.


* PureUserAdmin
http://pureuseradmin.sourceforge.net/

PureUserAdmin is a PHP based webbased application. Sys admins can use it to
easily manage the virtual users for their FTP server. PureUserAdmin is
developped to be used with Pure-FTPd but it should be able to be used with
other FTP servers as long as the FTP server gets the useraccount info from
MySQL or PostgreSQL.


* PurePostPro
http://82.71.1.246/stuff/purepostpro/

PurePostPro is a Perl/MySQL script that enables user uploads to be managed
more easily. New uploads are logged in a MySQL database, and duplicate files
are tracked using MD5 checksums.


* MySQmail Pure-FTPd logger
http://www.gplhost.com/software-mysqmail.html
http://packages.debian.org/en/squeeze/mail/mysqmail-pure-ftpd-logger

MySQMail is a set of tiny daemon loggers for mail and FTP servers that save
traffic information in a MySQL database. The information is split by domain
and by user so that it's easy to measure all the traffic for a given domain
name in real time.

This package provides a logger for FTP traffic handled by Pure-FTPd.

Current content of the "contrib" directory:

* xml_python_processors.txt (author: Jason Lunz):

  Two scripts to postprocess pure-ftpwho XML output. One returns a list of
dicts with the ftpwho data, each dict representing a connected client's
attribute. If you want to develop something related to ftpwho in Python,
this is a very good base.

  The other script creates a web page similar to "pure-ftpwho -w", but
better: you can choose which columns you want in which order and sort
the rows on multiple fields. You can also see bandwidth totals per
account.

* redhat.init (author: Bernhard Weisshuhn):

  A sample Red Hat init script.

* suse.init (author: Marc Thoben):

  A sample SuSE init script.

* pure-vpopauth.pl (author: Dan Caescu):

  An external authentication module for pure-ftpd using vpasswd
vpopmail password files.
  Run it the standard way with pure-authd.

* pure-stat.pl (author: Julien Andrieux):

  This script parses Apache-like log files and generates nice text summaries.
