  Thanks to Stefan Hornburg <racke at linuxia dot de>, there are now official
and maintained packages for Pure-FTPd in Debian unstable, available from your
preferred repository.

  Currently available packages are :
  
 - pure-ftpd
 - pure-ftpd-common
 - pure-ftpd-ldap
 - pure-ftpd-mysql
 
  Have fun with "aptitude" and please report any bug in order to improve these
packages.
