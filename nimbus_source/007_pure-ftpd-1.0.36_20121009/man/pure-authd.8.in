.SH "NAME"
.LP
pure\-authd \- External authentication agent for Pure\-FTPd.
.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP
pure\-authd [\fI\-p\fP <\fI/path/to/pidfile\fP>] [\fI\-u\fP uid] [\fI\-g\fP gid] [\fI\-B\fP] <\fI\-s\fP /path/to/socket> \fI\-r\fP /program/to/run

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
pure\-authd is a daemon that forks an authentication program, waits for an authentication reply, and feed them to an application server.
.LP
pure\-authd listens to a local Unix socket. A new connection to that socket should feed pure\-authd the following structure :
.IP
account:xxx

password:xxx

localhost:xxx

localport:xxx

peer:xxx

end
.LP
(replace xxx with appropriate values) . localhost, localport and peer are numeric IP addresses and ports. peer is the IP address of the remote client.
.LP
These arguments are passed to the authentication program, as environment variables :
.IP
AUTHD_ACCOUNT

AUTHD_PASSWORD

AUTHD_LOCAL_IP

AUTHD_LOCAL_PORT

AUTHD_REMOTE_IP

AUTHD_ENCRYPTED
.LP
The authentication program should take appropriate actions to fetch account info according to these arguments, and reply to the standard output a structure like the following one :
.IP
auth_ok:1

uid:42

gid:21

dir:/home/j

end

.TP
\fBauth_ok:\fRxxx
If xxx is 0, the user was not found (the next authentication method passed to pure\-ftpd will be tried) . If xxx is \-1, the user was found, but there was a fatal authentication error : user is root, password is wrong, account has expired, etc (next authentication methods will not be tried) . If xxx is 1, the user was found and successfully authenticated.
.TP
\fBuid:\fRxxx
The system uid to be assigned to that user. Must be > 0.
.TP
\fBgid:\fRxxx
The primary system gid. Must be > 0.
.TP
\fBdir:\fRxxx
The absolute path to the home directory. Can contain /./ for a chroot jail.
.TP
\fBslow_tilde_expansion:\fRxxx \fI(optional, default is 1)\fR
When the command 'cd ~user' is issued, it's handy to go to that user's home directory, as expected in a shell environment. But fetching account info can be an expensive operation for non\-system accounts. If xxx is 0, 'cd ~user' will expand to the system user home directory. If xxx is 1, 'cd ~user' won't expand. You should use 1 in most cases with external authentication, when your FTP users don't match system users. You can also set xxx to 1 if you're using slow nss_* system authentication modules.
.TP
\fBthrottling_bandwidth_ul:\fRxxx \fI(optional)\fR
The allocated bandwidth for uploads, in bytes per second.
.TP
\fBthrottling_bandwidth_dl:\fRxxx \fI(optional)\fR
The allocated bandwidth for downloads, in bytes per second.
.TP
\fBuser_quota_size:\fRxxx \fI(optional)\fR
The maximal total size for this account, in bytes.
.TP
\fBuser_quota_files:\fRxxx \fI(optional)\fR
The maximal number of files for this account.
.TP
\fBratio_upload:\fRxxx \fI(optional)\fR
.TP
\fBradio_download:\fRxxx \fI(optional)\fR
The user must match a ratio_upload:ratio_download ratio.
.LP
\fIOnly one authentication program is forked at a time. It must return quickly.\fR
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-u\fR <\fIuid\fP>
Have the daemon run with that uid.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR <\fIgid\fP>
Have the daemon run with that gid.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR
Fork in background (daemonization).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR <\fI/path/to/socket\fP>
Set the full path to the local Unix socket.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR <\fI/path/to/program\fP>
Set the full path to the authentication program.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Output help information and exit.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP
To run this program the standard way type:
.LP
pure\-authd \-s @LOCALSTATEDIR@/run/ftpd.sock \-r /usr/bin/my\-auth\-program &
.LP
pure\-ftpd \-lextauth:@LOCALSTATEDIR@/run/ftpd.sock &
.TP
/usr/bin/my\-auth\-program can be as simple as :
#! /bin/sh

echo 'auth_ok:1'

echo 'uid:42'

echo 'gid:21'

echo 'dir:/home/j'

echo 'end'
