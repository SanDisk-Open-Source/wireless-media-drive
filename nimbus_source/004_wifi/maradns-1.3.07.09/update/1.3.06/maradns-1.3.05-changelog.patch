 <H1>MaraDNS changelog</H1>
 
+<p>maradns-1.3.06:</p>
+This is a testing release of MaraDNS.
+<blockquote>
+<ul>
+<li>Bugfix: If <tt>bind_star_handling</tt> was set to 2, MaraDNS would
+leak memory when the existance of another RR stopped resolution using a
+star record.
+<li>Bugfix: <tt>bind_star_handling</tt>, when set to 2, now appears to
+do the right thing.
+<li>Testing: Unit tests for the five memory leaks that have appeared in the
+1.2/1.3 branches of MaraDNS.
+<li>Bugfix: The default <tt>max_mem</tt> is now a lot bigger when we
+need threads to perform recursion.
+</ul>
