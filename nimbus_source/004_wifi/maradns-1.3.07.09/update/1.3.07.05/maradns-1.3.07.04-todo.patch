+1.3.08 code: NAPTR
+
+Let's see: NAPTR.  RR code 35; two 16-bit unsigned numbers; three
+"character-strings" (thingys where you have a single byte indicating
+the length of the string, followed by the actural string.  No worries;
+MaraDNS has code to do all of this); and finally a <domain-name>.
+The <domain-name> is a little tricky, since the compression/decompression
+library will have to deal with them, but this should not be too hard
+(I haven't added a new RR to the compression core since 2002 or so).

 ---- Already done:
 
+Try to find and fix problem with inappropriate RR rotation.  If the bug is
+truly unreproducable, rewrite the rotation code. (DONE; bug found)
+
 Have a single megascript that does all of the SQA tests and lets us know 
 that we have passed all of them. (DONE)
