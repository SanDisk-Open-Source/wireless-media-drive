+It is possible to do this in MaraDNS 1.3 in two different ways.
+
+<p>
+
+One way is to set up MaraDNS' recursive resolver to use a custom 
+nameserver for a subset of the DNS space.  For example, the recursor can be
+told to go to "192.168.0.7" to look up all names that end in ".office".  More
+information about this is in the 
+<A href=recursive.html#privateroot>recursive DNS document</A>. 
+
+<p>
+
+The other method takes advantage of the fact that MaraDNS first looks up 
 authoritative names before performing recursion.  For example, if 
 <tt>www.google.com</tt> is defined in a MaraDNS zone file, MaraDNS
 will use the value in the zone file instead of contacting nameservers
