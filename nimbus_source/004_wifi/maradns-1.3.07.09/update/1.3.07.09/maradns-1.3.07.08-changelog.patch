 <H1>MaraDNS changelog</H1>
 
+<p>maradns-1.3.07.09:</p>
+This is the stable branch of MaraDNS.  
+<blockquote>
+<ul>
+<li>When sending a "host not here" reply, the RD and RA bits in the
+    header were correctly set.  Fixed.  I would like to thank 
+    Dr. Volker Jaenisch for not only pointing out this bug, but supplying
+    a patch to fix it.
+<li>A compile-time warning when compiling with GCC 4.1 removed.
+<li>mararc_n_verbose_query SQA regression updated to be more stable.
+</ul>
+Note: MaraDNS has <i>always</i> used random query IDs and source port 
+randomization generated using a cryptographically strong random number
+generator and was never vulnerable to the "new" DNS spoofing attack.<p>
+(2008.08.04)
+</blockquote>
+
+<p>maradns-1.2.12.10:</p>

+<p>maradns-1.3.11:</p>
+This is a development release of MaraDNS.
+<blockquote>
+<ul>
+<li>Bugfix: MaraDNS should now be able to compile on Mac OS X (Darwin)
+    again.
+<li>Some SQA test fixes: The private_ips test should now work in Fedora;
+    an uninitialized variable in the askmara.bug test is now initialized.
+    Thanks to Jean-Jacques Sarton for the bug reports and this fixes.
+<li>Default maximum memory allowed to be allocated greatly increased in
+    order to minimize the chances of the program dying because it can not
+    allocate memory.
+<li>Bugfix: RD value is now correctly echoed to client again
+<li>Bugfix: RA bit has (generally) a reasonably sensible value, since
+    some embedded devices actually check this bit.
+<li>TCP socket is released more quickly, allowing fast restarts of the TCP
+    zone server
+<li>Other updates to the SQA regressions
+<li>Improved cross-platform support, contributed by Jean-Jacques Sarton
+<li>Some improvments to askmara.c and askmara-tcp.c
+<li>Documentation typos kindly fixed by Boey Maun Suang
+<li>Updates to documentation (DjbDNS is now FOSS software, man page cleanup,
+    etc.)
+<li>Warn user if there is an unprintable control character in their zone file
+</ul>
