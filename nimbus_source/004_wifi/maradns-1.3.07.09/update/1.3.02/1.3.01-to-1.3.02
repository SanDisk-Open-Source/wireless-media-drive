# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.3.02 to 1.3.03, make sure 
# maradns-1.3.02.tar.bz2 is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.02*.patch files.

#           just released version  2.8.0 of the Pthreads library 
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.3.01-mingw.patch

# Patch #2: Refine how tildes in comments are parsed in csv2 zone
#           files: Tildes are now always allowed and never separate
#           records inside a comment.
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.3.01-tilde.patch

# Patch #3: Bugfix: Fix how stars records which are not authoritative
#           are processed.  Note that this increses the time needed before
#           Mara becomes recursive
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.3.01-noauth.star.records.patch

# Patch #4: Update the text form of the "paypal donate" button
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.3.01-paypal.text.patch

# Patch #5: Have MaraDNS skip all authoritative processing if there are
#           no authoritative records 
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.3.01-skip_auth.patch

# Patch #6: Update copyright statements and what not to reflect that
#           we are now in 2007
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.3.01-2007.patch

#           as root_servers["local."] = "192.168.1.12"
