 <h3>Pdnsd</h3>
 
 Pdnsd is an excellent little caching name server that predates MaraDNS.
-Years ago, the principal author stopped actively maintaining Pdnsd; while
-someone else started maintaining the software, there hasn't been a release 
-for over half a year.  I have heard that pdnsd has some stability problems;
-since it appears to be not actively maintined, these stability problems
-may never be addressed.
