  <h2>MaraDNS roadmap</h2>
  
! I am starting a 1.3 branch of MaraDNS.  The reason
! for the 1.2 to 1.3 jump is because I need to make some minor changes
! to the csv2 zone file format to make it feasible to finish my Python
! script that converts BIND zone files to csv2 zone files.
  
! <p>
! 
! The plan is this: Have a tilde (~) separate records.  Require that the
! tilde is only used to separate records.  I chose the tilde because
! it's a character that one is usually not going to have in comments nor
! in TXT/SPF/RAW records.
! 
! <p>
! 
! What the csv2 parser will do is parse the first record.  If it sees a
! tilde between the end of the first record and the beginning of the
! second record, the parser will require that there be a tilde between
! every single record.  A tilde will not be allowed anywhere else in a
! csv2 zone file; a tilde will not be allowed in comments nor in TXT/SPF
! records, for example.  If you need a tilde in a TXT record, use the
! \x7e escape sequence.
! 
! <p>
! 
! For
! people who have csv2 zone files with tildes in them already, it will
! be possible to disable this new behavior by setting a new mararc
! variable, called csv2_tilde_handling, to 0.
! 
! <p>
! 
! Basically, I am transitioning zone files from looking like this:
! 
! <pre>
! %       SOA     % email@% 1 7200 3600 604800 1800
! %       NS      a.%
! %       NS      b.%
! a.example.net.  10.10.10.10
! b.example.net.  10.10.10.11
! b.example.net.  10.10.10.12
! Z.EXAMPLE.NET.  10.2.3.4
! Y.EXAMPLE.net.  10.3.4.5
! percent.%       a               10.9.8.7
! *.example.net.  A               10.11.12.13
! d.example.net. +86400 A 10.11.12.13
! f.example.net.
!                 A       10.2.19.83
! </pre>
! 
! To looking like this:
! 
! <pre>
! %       SOA     % email@% 1 7200 3600 604800 1800 ~
! %       NS      a.% ~
! %       NS      b.% ~
! a.example.net.  10.10.10.10 ~
! b.example.net.  10.10.10.11 ~
! b.example.net.  10.10.10.12 ~
! Z.EXAMPLE.NET.  10.2.3.4
! ~
! Y.EXAMPLE.net.  10.3.4.5
! ~
! percent.%       a               10.9.8.7 ~
! *.example.net.  A               10.11.12.13 ~
! d.example.net. +86400 A 10.11.12.13 ~
! f.example.net.
!                 A       10.2.19.83 ~
! </pre>
! 
! Once I make these changes to the csv2 parser, I will finish the Python
! script to convert BIND zone files to csv2 zone files.
! 
! I also plan on making the following small changes to the 1.3 branch:
! 
! <ul>
! <li>
! I'll add two variables, bind_port and upstream_port, which allow
! MaraDNS to bind to or listen on other ports.  This makes certain
! setups where we're using MaraDNS to handle dangling CNAME records
! easier.
! <li>
!  I'll make it possible to customize the nameserver used to
! recursively resolve a given subdomain.  A lot of djbdns refugees miss
! this feature, and this won't be too difficult to add (as long as
! upstream_servers and root_servers aren't both set; I'll continue to
! prohibit that).
! <li>
! udpany() will be rewritten to be two functions; one to be used by
! the authoritative code; one by the recursive code.  This function
! currently is ugly looking.
! </ul>
! 
! After doing this, I plan on rewriting the recursive resolver.
! Basically, the code is quite ugly and this recursive resolver has been
! needing a rewrite for a few years now.  While I'm at it, I may as well
! add ipv6 support to the recursive half of Mara.
  
  <p>
  
! After that, I'll revamp the authoritative code to handle AXFRs
! correctly and to have "views".
