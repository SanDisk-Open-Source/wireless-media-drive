# containing the tarball for the version of MaraDNS you wish to update, and
# all of the patches are in a directory entitled 'patches'.

# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.2.02 to 1.2.03, make sure 
# maradns-1.2.02.tar.lzma is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.02*.patch files.

# You will need to have lzma on your system to run this script

# Get the current and next version number
