 <H1>MaraDNS changelog</H1>
 
-<p>maradns-1.3.02:
+<p>maradns-1.3.03:<p>
+This is a testing release of MaraDNS.
+<blockquote>
+<ul>
+<li>Memory leak found by Rani Assaf plugged.
+<li>Whether to recurse when MaraDNS would otherwise give out a NS delegation
+    record is now a user-settable feature.
+<li>Bugfix: '.' can now be a hostname by itself.
+<li>Bugfix: MaraDNS now compiles with gcc 2.96 again.
+<li>The version.maradns special query now works in a 100% recursive server
+    again (as long as admin_acl is set and gives permissions).
+<li>When the tilde is used to separate records, it is no longer necessary to
+    have some of the WKS or LOC fields be on the same line.  
+<li>When the tilde is used to separate records, it is no longer possible
+    to have a pipe (|), hash (#), or nonprintable control character in a 
+    TXT record.  This will make parsing of csv2 files by scripts easier.
+<li>When the tilde is used to separate records, multiple TXT chunks can
+    now be separated by whitespace.  This allows for 
+    <tt>foo.%&nbsp;TXT&nbsp;'chunk&nbsp;1'&nbsp;'chunk&nbsp;2'</tt> records.
+<li>Documentation updates.
+</ul>
