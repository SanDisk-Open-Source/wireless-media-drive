 Impact: Theoretical local spoofing of DNS records.
+<li>
+There was a remote denial of service problem where someone could
+disable MaraDNS' recursion by sending thousands of
+specially crafted DNS packets per second to a server running MaraDNS.  MaraDNS
+would function normally again once the DNS packets were no longer being
+sent.  This affected all versions of MaraDNS, and was fixed in
+MaraDNS 1.2.12.05, 1.0.40, and 1.3.04.
+<p>
+
+Impact: Remote Denial of Service.
+<li>
+MaraDNS would leak approximately 20 bytes 
+whenever an invalid DNS packet was received.  This leak would have
+allowed an attacker to cause MaraDNS to allocate an arbitrary large
+amount of memory by sending a very large number of invalid DNS
+packers to the server running MaraDNS.  This affected the 1.2 and
+1.3 branches of MaraDNS, and was fixed in MaraDNS 1.2.12.05
+and the 1.3.04 release of MaraDNS.
