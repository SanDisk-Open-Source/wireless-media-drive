# containing the tarball for the version of MaraDNS you wish to update, and
# all of the patches are in a directory entitled 'patches'.

# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.2.02 to 1.2.03, make sure 
# maradns-1.2.02.tar.lzma is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.02*.patch files.

# You will need to have lzma on your system to run this script

# Get the current and next version number

# This is only done when more than one snapshop is uploaded to the
# maradns.org server in a given day.

echo applying patches

# Patch #1: Update FAQ to address synth IP problem.
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-synth-ip-faq.patch

# Patch #2: Update ej2man to work with both Perl 5.8.0 and 5.8.8
# (the contortions to work around Perl's 5.8.0 Unicode bugs are
#  insane)
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-perl_unicode_mess.patch

# Patch #3: Update ej2txt to work with newer versions of links
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-ej2txt.patch

# Patch #4: Update makefile.linux to have "make debug" work again
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-makefile.linux.patch

# Patch #5: Update JsStrOS.c; give it copyright notice, etc
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-JsStrOS.patch

# Patch #6: Update documentation to point out "make debug" really slows
#           things down
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-make_debug_doc.patch

# Patch #7: Add the mararc variable csv2_tilde_handling; this is right now
#           just a placeholder so there is maxiumum compatibility between
#           the current and future versions of MaraDNS
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-csv2_tilde_handling.patch

# Patch #8: Make udpany() case-insensitive
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-any_case_issue.patch

# Patch #9: Make the port we use for contacting remote DNS servers the
# #define'd UPSTREAM_PORT variable; this allows this parameter to be
# fairly easily changed, which is useful in situtations when you need to
# resolve dangling IPs but only have one IP do do it with.
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.12.03-upstream_port.patch
