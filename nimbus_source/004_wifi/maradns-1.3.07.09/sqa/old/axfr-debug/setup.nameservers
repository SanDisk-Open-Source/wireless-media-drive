This file describes how to set up various other DNS packages to 
transfer over a zone file.

--

DjbDNS:

To transfer over the zone for example.com, using the axfr-get client 
that djbdns comes with, to a DNS server with the IP 127.0.0.3:

tcpclient 127.0.0.3 53 axfr-get example.com foo foo.tmp

Where tcpclient is a tool that ucspi-tcp comes with, and axfr-get is a tool
that djbdns comes with (the daemontools package does not have to be 
installed).

To compile ucspi-tcp on Linux, type in this command before 'make'

	echo gcc -O2 -include /usr/include/errno.h > conf-cc

Bind8/9:

Bind 8 and Bind 9 use the exact same configuration file.

/etc/named.conf should look like this:

options {
        directory "/var/named";
};

zone "example.com" {
  type slave;
  file "example.com.zone";
  masters { 127.0.0.3; };
};

Make sure there is a directory named /var/named, and that this directory
does not have a file called "example.com.zone".  Make sure that the
"example.com.zone" file is created by the zone transfer.  Look in
/var/log/messages for bind's output.

Bind 4:

Bind 4 has been declared deprecated by ISC, and doesn't compile in
Fedora core 3.  As I recall, I sucessfully transferred zone files to
a Bind 4 server back in the 0.5.xx days, when I wrote the original
zone server.
