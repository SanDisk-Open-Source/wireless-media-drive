percent parse bug

Description: DNS records ending in a % immediately followed by an ip did
             not correctly parse 

Expected output of test: A query for www.example.com resolves 

Presence of bug output: A query for www.example.com does not resolve

When fixed: Does not appear to ever have been a bug; maybe more records in a
            zone file will trigger it.
