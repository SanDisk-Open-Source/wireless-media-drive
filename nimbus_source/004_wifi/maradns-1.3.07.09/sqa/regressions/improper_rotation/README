Improper rotation of CNAME record bug

Found by: Michael Krieger 

Description: CNAME records were improperly rotated when a NS query for the
             CNAME record was sent.

Expected output of test: The first RR in the DNS reply is the CNAME record

Presence of bug output: The first RR in the DNS reply is an NS record

Workaround: Add "max_ar_chain = 2" to one's mararc file in order to disable 
            RR rotation; or just update maradns

When fixed: 1.0.41; 1.2.12.08; 1.3.07.04
