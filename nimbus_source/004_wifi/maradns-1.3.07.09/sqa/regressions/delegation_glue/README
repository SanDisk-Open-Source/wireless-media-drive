Delegation glue

Description: This verifiees that MaraDNS correctly shows glue records 
             when delegating nameservers

Expected output of test: A (IP) query for www.sub.example.com gives ip for 
                         ns.sub.example.com 

Presence of bug output: A (IP) query for www.sub.example.com does not give 
                        ip for ns.sub.example.com

When fixed: Never a known bug; but a useful regression to have
