long.chunk

Descrption: MaraDNS would not always correctly report that a TXT chunk
            was too long.

Expected output of test: MaraDNS complains that TXT chunk is too long.

Presence of bug output: MaraDNS loads the zone file without reporting an
                        error.

When fixed: 1.3.07.02
