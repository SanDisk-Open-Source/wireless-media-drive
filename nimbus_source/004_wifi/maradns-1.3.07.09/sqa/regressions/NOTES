These are notes for the various mararc_d (MaraDNS dictionary variable)
and mararc_n (MaraDNS normal variable) tests in this directory.

The following mararc parameters do not have tests:

	maximum_cache_elements
	maxprocs
	max_tcp_procs
	max_mem
	no_fingerprint (see below)
	random_seed_file
	recurse_min_bind_port
	recurse_number_ports
	retry_cycles
	tcp_convert_acl
	tcp_convert_server
	timeout_seconds
	zone_transfer_acl

The following mararc parameters look to not work or be outdated:

	no_fingerprint (The decompression code eats the kinds of
                        packets where no_fingerprint matters)
        max_glueless_level (Doesn't appear to do anything)
        max_queries_total (Doesn't appear to do anything) 

I have undocumented these outdated mararc variables.

The following mararc parameter tests have to be done by hand

	timestamp_type
	verbose_level
