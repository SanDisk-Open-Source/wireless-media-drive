truncation

Descrption: This test makes sure that MaraDNS correctly performs RFC2181
            compliant truncation.

Expected output of test: MaraDNS correctly truncates the records, and has
                         an output that looks like output.success

Presence of bug output: MaraDNS does not correctly truncate the records, and
                        has an output that looks like one of the output.fail
                        files

When fixed: 1.2.12.02
