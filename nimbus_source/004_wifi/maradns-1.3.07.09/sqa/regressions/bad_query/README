Bogus invalid query message bug

Description: DNS lookups would incorrectly give out invalid query responses
             in addition to the desired answer

Expected output of test: No extra invalid query message 

Presence of bug output: Extra invalid query message

When fixed: 1.2.12.03

NOTE: Should something break DNS recursion, this is the first SQA test case
      to fail.
