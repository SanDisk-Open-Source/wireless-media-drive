star_handling_leak

Description: If the mararc variable bind_star_handling had a value of 2,
             MaraDNS would leak memory when resolving a star record whose
             resolution is blocked by the presence of another record.

Expected output of test: MaraDNS does not leak memory

Presence of bug output: MaraDNS leaks memory

When fixed: 1.3.06

Note: Valgrind needed to run this test
