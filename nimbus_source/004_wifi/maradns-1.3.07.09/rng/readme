[Note that I have made some modifications to the code; read
 README.maradns.  In particular, this is no longer Rijndael, but
 a hash-only Rijndael variant.]

We are deeply indebted to the following people for their bug reports,
fixes, and improvement suggestions to the API implementation. Though we
tried to list all contributions, we apologise in advance for any

Description:

This optimised implementation of Rijndael is noticeably faster than the
previous versions on Intel processors under Win32 w/ MSVC 6.0.  On the
same processor under Linux w/ gcc-2.95.2, the key setup is also
considerably faster, but normal encryption/decryption is only marginally
faster.

To enable full loop unrolling for encryption/decryption, define the
conditional compilation directive FULL_UNROLL.  This may help increase
performance or not, depending on the platform.

To compute the intermediate value tests, define the conditional
compilation directive INTERMEDIATE_VALUE_KAT.  It may be worthwhile to
define the TRACE_KAT_MCT directive too, which provides useful progress
information during the generation of the KAT and MCT sets.

========================================================================

N.B. Both the API implementation and the provisional reduced set of
test vectors are likely to change, according to NIST's final decision
regarding modes of operation and the FIPS contents. They are therefore
marked as "version 2.9" rather than "version 3.0".
