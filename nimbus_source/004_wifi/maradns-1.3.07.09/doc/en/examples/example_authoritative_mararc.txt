# Example simplified mararc file.  
# This only shows a subset of MaraDNS' features needed to be an
# authoritative name server; see the file example_full_mararc for a
# mararc file that uses most of the parameters that can be set in a 
# mararc file.

# The address this DNS server runs on.  If you want to bind 
# to multiple addresses, separate them with a comma like this:
# "10.1.2.3,10.1.2.4,127.0.0.1"
ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
# The directory with all of the zone files
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"

# The various zones we support

# We must initialize the csv2 hash, or MaraDNS will not
# load any zone files
csv2 = {}

# Here is a pointer to a zone file for example.com
csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"
# And a pointer to a zone file for example.org
csv2["example.org."] = "db.example.org"
