These are miscellaneous technical documents which describe the internals
of MaraDNS; none of these documents need to be translated when 
translating user-documentation.  Most of these documents are in ASCII
text format; some are in HTML format; one is in both HTML and AbiWord
format; and the notes on the man page
macros are in man format.
