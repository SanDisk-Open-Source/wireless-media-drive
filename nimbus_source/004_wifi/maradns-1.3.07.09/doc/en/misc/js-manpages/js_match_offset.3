.SH NAME
js_match_offset \- search for any literal character in exp in the string js
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "JsStr.h"
.sp
.B "int js_match_offset(js_string *exp, js_string *js, int offset)"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B js_match_offset
searches for any single character in the expression 
.B exp
in the string
.B js.

The expression 
.B exp
is treated as a list of characters we look for in the string
.B js.
No characters are considered metacharacters in the expression
.B exp.

The argument
.B offset
determines the minimum offset we will look for a character in the expression
.B exp
at.  An offset of 0 indicates we start looking at the beginning of the
string
.B js, 
an offset of 1 means that we will start looking at the second character 
in the string, and so on.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B js_match_offset
returns -2 if none of the characters in
.B exp
was found in the string
.B js,
the offset of the first found character if the string was found (0 if it 
was found at the top of the string, 1 if it was found starting at the 
second character in the string, etc), and 
.I JS_ERROR
if there was an error when searching for a character in the expression.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example will find the second character 3 in the string "543" 
in the string "3634567890":

.nf
	js_string *foo, *bar;
	foo = js_create(256,1);
	bar = js_create(256,1);
	js_str2js(foo,"3634567890",10,1);
	js_str2js(bar,"543",3,1);
	printf("%d\\n",js_match_offset(bar,foo,1)); /* You will see 2 */
