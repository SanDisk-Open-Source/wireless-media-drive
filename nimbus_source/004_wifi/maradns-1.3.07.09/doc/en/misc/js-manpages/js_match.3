.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B js_match
searches for any single character in the expression 
.B exp
in the string
.B js.

The expression 
.B exp
is treated as a list of characters we look for in the string
.B js.
No characters are considered metacharacters in the expression
.B exp.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B js_match
returns -2 if none of the characters in
.B exp
was found in the string
.B js,
the offset of the first found character if the string was found (0 if it 
was found at the top of the string, 1 if it was found starting at the 
second character in the string, etc), and 
.I JS_ERROR
if there was an error when searching for a character in the expression.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example will find the character 3 in the string "543" 
in the string "1234567890":

.nf
	js_string *foo, *bar;
	foo = js_create(256,1);
	bar = js_create(256,1);
	js_str2js(foo,"1234567890",10,1);
	js_str2js(bar,"543",3,1);
	printf("%d\\n",js_match(bar,foo)); /* You will see 2 */
