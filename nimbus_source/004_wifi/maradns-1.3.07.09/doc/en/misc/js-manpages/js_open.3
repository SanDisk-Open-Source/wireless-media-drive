.SH NAME
js_open \- Private function that opens up a file with open(2)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "JsStr.h"
.sp
.B "void js_open(js_string *filename, js_file *desc, int flags)"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B js_open
is a function that opens up a file with open(2), using the
contents in the
.I js_string
object
.B filename
to determine the file name, and 
.B flags
to determine the opening flags.
.B desc 
is where we store the opened file descriptor.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B js_open
is a void function.  The member 
.I filetype
of the structure
.I desc
will have an invalid value if an error occured opening the file.
.SH NOTES
Please do not use this function. Use
.BR js_open_read ,
.BR js_open_write ,
or
.B js_open_append
instead.

I am declaring this function a private function because programs using
the 
.I js_string
library really should not be utilizing Unix-specific file flags.  In other
words, use this function at your own risk, because I may change the
interface of this function or delete this function altogether in
future releases of the
.I js_string 
library.
