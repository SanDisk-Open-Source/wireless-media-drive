This is documentation for the js string library, which is a buffer-overflow
resistant string library which MaraDNS uses.

Note that this documentation does not have all functions that the string
library has, since this documentation actually predates MaraDNS--my 
previous project, the Kiwi spam-protection package, used the same
string library, and this documentation has (by and large) not been 
updated since then.
