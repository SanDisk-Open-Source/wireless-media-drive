EJ is a document format which I made specifically for MaraDNS documentation.

All of the tags which EJ supports are described fully in the README.ej
document in the same directory as the ej scripts

EJ is essentially HTML; here are the differences between making an EJ
document and making a HTML document:

* An EJ document requires a HEAD and a BODY section.  

* The HEAD section can have three tags: TITLE; META (but only to declare 
  the charset); and three tags which do not exist in html: One called TH;
  one called DTWIDTH; and one called BODYFLAGS

  The header must have a line in this format:

    <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; CHARSET=utf-8">

  Where the CHARSET is the charset that the EJ document uses. 
  For man page conversions, the document will be converted to iso 8859-1
  using iconv; as a practical matter this means that documents using
  characters outside of 8859-1 (the first 256 spots of Unicode) can not 
  be converted in to man pages.

  The TH tag is used for converting EJ documents in to man pages; it
  has five parts: 
  
   1. The name of the man page; usually same as the filename of the
      document
   2. The section the man page is placed in
   3. The date the man page was written
   4. The program for which the man page was written; this is placed
      in the bottom left hand corner of every single page of the
      document
   5. What this man page should be filed as; this is placed in the top
      center of every single page of the document

  DTWIDTH determines how wide to make DT headings when translating to the 
  man page format; if a given DT heading is too wide for the allowed space,
  the DD section will roll over to the next line

  BODYFLAGS are flags given to the BODY tag when the document is 
  converted in to HTML.  This is here to allow an HTML document to
  be more aestically pleasing.

* The BODY section uses two tags which do not exist in html: 

  1. The INCLUDE tag, which is used for loading the contents of another 
     file, and embedding the contents of that file in the EJ document.
 
  2. The HINCLUDE tag, which is like the INCLUDE tag, but is designed
     to include HTML code which makes a rendered web page more 
     aestically pleasing; this code is included only when rendering the 
     EJ document in question in to HTML.

  EJ docs support the following HTML tags: <H1> (becomes section header
  when translating to man page); <H2>; <B> and </B>; <I> and </I>; <UL>
  and </UL>; <LI>; <PRE> and </PRE>; <BLOCKQUOTE> and </BLOCKQUOTE>;
  <P>; <A ...> and </A>; <TT> and </TT>; <DL>, <DT>, and <DD>; <HR> and
  finally <BR>.

  EJ also supports <TABLE>, <TD>, and <TR> tags, but only in a very
  limited fashion when converting to man pages; a table can only have
  three columns, and the first two columns need to be fairly short
  fields, and the third column can not be more than 35 characters (or
  so) long.

* In addition, the EJ doc format supports the <!-- ... --> form for
  comments; these comments will not be visible in the rendered HTML
  page or man document (perhaps EJ needs a comment tag which generates
  comments in the rendered man page/HTML document which HTML/man renderers
  will not see when rendering the page)
