<H1>Introduction to DNS</H1>

This document is meant to be an introduction to DNS for someone who has
never administrated a DNS server or registered a domain before.  Being a
part of the MaraDNS package, this tutorial assumes that one is using
the MaraDNS package.

<H2>What is DNS?</H2>

DNS is the method that the internet uses to convert difficult-to-remember
numbers, such as '10.17.243.32', in to easy-to-remember names, such as
'www.yahoo.com'.  The reason for this conversion is because the underlying
protocol for the internet, TCP/IP, uses difficult-to-remember numbers
to connect to other computers.

<H2>What is a DNS server</H2>

A <!-- This 'A' should be here -->
<A href="glossary.html#dns_server">
<i>DNS server</i></A>
is a program that performs the DNS conversion from 
names in to number.  There are three kinds of DNS servers out there:

<UL>

<LI>DNS servers which can convert most 
<A href="glossary.html#dns_node"><i>DNS nodes</i></A>
in to thier
corresponding number.  These DNS servers are called 
<A href="glossary.html#recursive">
<i>recursive DNS servers</i></A>.
This kind of server can not change the names of any 
<A href="glossary.html#dns_node">
<i>DNS nodes</i></A>
out there.  Instead, they simply ask other DNS servers the IP
for a given DNS node.  

<p>

This kind of DNS server does not depend on one's ISP DNS servers 
to resolve a given name, but directly contacts the relevant authoritative
DNS servers anywhere on the internet to resolve a given DNS node.

<LI>DNS servers which can only convert 
<A href="glossary.html#dns_node">
<i>DNS nodes</i></A>
which a 
<A href="glossary.html#dns_admin">
<i>DNS server administrator</i></A>
manages from DNS nodes in to IPs.  The DNS
server administrator can change the IPs that the DNS nodes have.  
These kinds of DNS servers are called
<A href="glossary.html#authoritative">
<i>authoritative DNS servers</i></A>.
Recursive DNS servers contact authoritative DNS servers in order to learn
the IP for a given DNS node. 

<LI>DNS servers which simply cache information obtained from other 
    recursive DNS servers.  While, MaraDNS supports this type of 
    configuration via the "upstream_servers" 
    <A href=man.mararc.html>mararc</A> variable, MaraDNS can also act
    as a full fledged recursive DNS server.

</UL>

MaraDNS is both a recursive and an authoritative DNS server.  Whether one 
needs a recursive or an authoritative DNS server depends on what one is 
trying to do with dns:

<UL>

<LI>If one simply wishes to contact other sites on the internet, one only
    needs to set up a 
    <A href="glossary.html#recursive">
    <i>recursive DNS server</i></A>.
    <A href=recursive.html>Tutorial for setting up MaraDNS as a recursive 
    DNS server</A>

<LI>If one wishes to register domains, and have their own computers serve 
    the domain names in question, then one needs to set up an 
    <A href="glossary.html#authoritative">
    <i>authoritative DNS server</i></A>.  
    <A href=authoritative.html>Tutorial
    for setting up MaraDNS as an authoritative DNS server.</A>

<LI>If one has a current DNS setup using another DNS server, 
    <A href=convert.html>this document details how to convert from 
    another DNS server to MaraDNS</A>.
