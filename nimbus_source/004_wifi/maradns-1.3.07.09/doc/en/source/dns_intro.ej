<H1>What is DNS?</H1>

DNS is something that the majority of internet users are not aware or or
take for granted, but is essential for the internet to function.  Plain
simply put, without DNS, there is no internet.  Anyone that wants to use the
internet needs a DNS server or access to a DNS server.  This is why every
internet service provider provides DNS servers for their customers to
use.

<p>

There are, however, disadvantages to using an ISP's DNS servers.  The main
disadvantage is that the servers might be overloaded; every single internet
connection (every single email sent, every single web page accessed, etc.)
requires a DNS query.  With a large number of customers querying the same
two DNS servers over and over again, those servers can become slow and
overloaded.

<p>

This is why you may wish to run your own DNS server.  This DNS server can
run much faster than your ISP's DNS servers, allowing you to access
the internet much more quickly.

<p>

There are actually a couple of ways of using a DNS server to speed up the
internet; but first I should describe what DNS is.

<p>

DNS is the process of taking a name, such as "www.yahoo.com" and 
converting it in to a number, such as "10.22.45.32".  It is, if
you will, the phone book of the internet.   

<p>

As I said before, there are two ways to have your own DNS server
speed up the internet.  One is to simply act as a cache: A program 
that queries your ISP's DNS servers once for "www.yahoo.com", and
remembers the number (this number is called an "IP") for you so that
you don't need to ask your ISP the number for www.yahoo.com every
time you go to that web site.  This is what I call a downstream
DNS server.  MaraDNS, naturally, fully supports this mode of
operation.

<p>

The other way is to have your DNS servers do what your ISP's DNS
servers do: Directly query various machines on the internet for 
the IP for "www.yahoo.com", and give you the answer after doing all
of the bureaucracy needed to find out what the IP for "www.yahoo.com"
is.  This is what I call a recursive DNS server.  MaraDNS, naturally,
also fully supports this mode of operation.  Indeed, this is the easiest
mode of operation to set up for MaraDNS.

<p>

Now, as I said before, there is some nasty bureaucracy involved in 
converting "www.yahoo.com" from a name in to an IP (as long as you don't
ask your ISP's DNS servers to do it for you).  This bureaucracy involves
querying various servers on the internet for "www.yahoo.com".  To make a
long story short, if you want to host your own domains, such as 
"www.yourname.com", you will need to run your own DNS server.  This kind
of DNS server is not used to speed up the internet, but is used so that
other DNS servers can find out the IP for "www.yourname.com".  This kind
of DNS server is called an authoritative DNS server.  MaraDNS, you guessed
it, fully supports this mode of operation.
