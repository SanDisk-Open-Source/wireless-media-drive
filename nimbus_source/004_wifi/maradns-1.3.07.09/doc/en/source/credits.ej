One of the things that is very delightful about writing open-source 
software is the incredible amount of help people have been offering
me with MaraDNS.  Numerous people have provided invaluable assistance
with filing bug reports, making usability suggesations, providing
patches and reports with respect to running MaraDNS on other operating
systems, and otherwise making MaraDNS a superior program.
