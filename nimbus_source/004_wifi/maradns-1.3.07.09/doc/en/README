People interested in translating documentation need only translate 
documentation in the "source/" directory; all user-level documentation
is generated from these source files.

The documentation is in a format called "ej"; ej is a format created
to meet the needs of people who are translating MaraDNS documentation.
The format is an XMLish format; in fact, it mostly resembles HTML.  The
converters which convert from "ej" to the various document formats are
in the directory tools/ej.  Currently there are three tools: ej2html,
ej2man, and ej2txt, which, as expected, convert documents from the
ej format to html, man page *roff source (using man macros), and
to text format.
