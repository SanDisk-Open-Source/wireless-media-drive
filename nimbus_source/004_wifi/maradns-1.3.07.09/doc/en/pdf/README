These files need to annp.tmac file to compile.  The supplied tmac.an.patch
file is the diff between the file an-old.tmac which comes with Groff 1.18.1 
and the annp.tmac macro set which the ej2ps script uses.

The generated PDF files are optimized to print on to Letter paper.  This is
set in doc/en/man/make.pdf if you wish to make this A4 or what not (look 
for -P -pletter).
