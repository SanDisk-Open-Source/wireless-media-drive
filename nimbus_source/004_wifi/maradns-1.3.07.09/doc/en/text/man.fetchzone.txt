   fetchzone - get dns zone from server

                             DESCRIPTION

   fetchzone transfers a user-specified dns zone from a zone server
   and displays it in csv2 format on the standard output.

                                USAGE

   fetchzone zone_name zone_server_IP [query_class]

                               OPTIONS

   zone_name

   Name of the dns zone to be transferred.

   zone_server_IP

   IP address of dns server

   query_class

   Optional argument which can change the query class from 1 (the
   default) to 255. This may be needed for some versions of Bind.

                               EXAMPLES

   To obtain the zone example.com from the server 192.168.9.8:

 fetchzone example.com 192.168.9.8

   To obtain the zone example.org from the server 10.9.8.78 using a
   query class of 255:

 fetchzone example.com 10.9.8.78 255

                                 BUGS

   Fetchzone will not correctly output host names with utf-8
   characters in them.
