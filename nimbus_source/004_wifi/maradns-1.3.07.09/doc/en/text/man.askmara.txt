   askmara - do simple dns queries

                             DESCRIPTION

   askmara queries the user-specified dns server for records, and
   outputs the reply in a csv2-compatible format (csv2 is the
   format of zone files that maradns uses).

                                USAGE

   askmara [-n] [ -v | -t timeout] query [ server ]

                               OPTIONS

   -t
           If this is present, the following argument is the
           askmara timeout, in seconds. Note that askmara can not
           both have a user-defined timeout and verbose output.

   -v
           If this is set, askmara will verbosely output the
           complete reply that the server sent. Note that this
           verbose output is not csv2-compatible.

   -n
           If this is set, askmara, when sending out a query, will
           not request DNS recursion; in other words, askmara will
           request that the remote DNS server not contact other DNS
           server to answer the query in question.

   query
           dns record to be queried. The query has two sections:
           The type of record we desire, and the hostname we want
           this record for.

           The type of query can have two forms: A one-letter
           mnemonic, or a numeric rtype followed by a colon. This
           is immediately concatenated by the full name of the host
           name we wish to look up.

           For example, to ask for the IP of 'example.com.', we can
           use the one-letter mnemonic, in the form
           'Aexample.com.', or we can use the numeric RR followed
           by a colon, giving the query '1:example.com.' (since A
           has the record type of one). Note that the query name
           needs the trailing dot at the end.

           Askmara supports a handful one-letter mnemonics, as
           follows:

           A signifies a request for an A (ipv4 address) RR

           N signifies a NS RR

           C signifies that we are asking for a CNAME RR

           S signifies that we want a SOA RR

           P signifies that we want a PTR RR

           @ signifies that we mant a MX RR

           T signifies that we want a TXT RR

           Z signifies that we want to ask for all RRs.

   server
           IP address of the dns server to be queried. If no server
           is given, askmara will query 127.0.0.1.

                               EXAMPLES

   Asking the server with the ip 127.0.0.1 for the IP address of
   example.com:

 askmara Aexample.com.

   Asking the server with the ip 198.41.0.4 for the IP address of
   example.com:

 askmara Aexample.com. 198.41.0.4

   Asking the server with the ip address 127.0.0.1 for the IP
   address of example.com, using the rr_number:query format:

 askmara 1:example.com.

   Asking the server with the ip address 127.0.0.1 for a SRV
   record. In particular, we ask for the "http over tcp" service
   for example.net. Since askmara doesn't have a mnemonic for SRV
   record types, we use the numeric code (33 for SRV):

 askmara 33:_http._tcp.example.net.

   Asking the server with the ip address 127.0.0.1 for the AAAA
   (ipv6 ip) record for example.net:

 askmara 28:example.net.

   Note that the output will be a raw DNS packet in both the SRV
   and AAAA examples.

                                 BUGS

   When askmara is asked for an SOA record, the output of askmara
   closely resembles the format of a csv2 file, but can not be
   parsed as a csv2 file without modification.

   askmara outputs multi-chunk ("character-string") TXT records
   incorrectly (it only outputs the first chunk).
