                          Compiling MaraDNS

Requirements

   MaraDNS needs a UNIX-compatible operating system, ideally one
   which is not proprietary, such as Linux or FreeBSD. MaraDNS is
   currently being developed on a CentOS 3.6 (RHEL 3 compatible)
   machine.

   MaraDNS currently will only compile on Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin,
   and Mac OS X systems. Other systems can be easily ported to.
   MaraDNS also has partial MinGW32 support; this allows MaraDNS to
   (partially) run as a native Win32 binary.

Downloading, compiling, and installing MaraDNS

     * Obtain MaraDNS from www.maradns.org
     * Extract the MaraDNS tarball:

         bzip2 -cd maradns-*.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

     * Enter the directory that the above extraction generated.
     * Compile MaraDNS. Type in ./configure followed by make in the
       top-level MaraDNS directory.
     * Install the MaraDNS package. As root:

         make install

       This will install both the binaries and the man pages for
       'maradns', 'askmara', 'duende', 'fetchzone', and
       'zoneserver'. In addition, this will (if the files are not
       already present), install an example /etc/mararc, make the
       /etc/maradns directory, and place an example zone file
       (db.example.com) in /etc/maradns. Finally, this will place
       MaraDNS documentation in /usr/local/doc.
