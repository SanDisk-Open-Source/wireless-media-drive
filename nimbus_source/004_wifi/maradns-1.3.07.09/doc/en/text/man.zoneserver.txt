   zoneserver - handle zone transfers and other TCP functions for
   MaraDNS

                             DESCRIPTION

   zoneserver listens on port 53/tcp and handles DNS zone transfers
   and any DNS query done over TCP instead of UDP. zoneserver uses
   a configuration file, /etc/mararc by default, to determine its
   parameters.

                                USAGE

   zoneserver -f pointer_to_mararc_file

                               OPTIONS

   -f
           Specifies the location of the configuration file.
           MaraDNS uses the same configuration file for both the
           main dns server and the zoneserver.

                      CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

   The file format for the mararc file can be found in the
   mararc(5) manual page. In particular, the zoneserver uses the
   zone_transfer_acl, tcp_convert_acl, tcp_convert_server,
   bind_address, and recursive_acl mararc parameters.

                         EXAMPLE MARARC FILE

   In this example mararc file, which is used both by maradns and
   zoneserver, we allow 10.1.2.3, 10.1.14.7, and 192.168.116.{any}
   to transfer zones, and we allow anyone on the internet to
   perform TCP queries. The only zone served in this example is
   example.com:

 ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.1.1.1" # Our IP
 tcp_convert_server = "10.1.1.1" # IP of UDP DNS server
 tcp_convert_acl = "0.0.0.0/0" # Anyone may do DNS-over-TCP
 chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns" # Where zone files are
 csv2 = {} # Initialize list of zone files
 csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com" # example.com zone file
 # The next line is a list of who can transfer zones from us
 zone_transfer_acl = "10.1.2.3, 10.1.14.7, 192,168.116.0/24"

                                 BUGS

   zoneserver assumes that the authoritative NS records are
   immediately after the SOA record, and that there is at least one
   non-NS between that last authority NS record for the zone and
   the first delegation NS record.

   IXFR requests are incremental zone transfers, meaning that the
   DNS server should only display records changed since the last
   IXFR request. zoneserver, however, treats an IXFR as if it were
   an AXFR request, outputting all of the records for the zone in
   question.

   zoneserver closes the TCP connection after transferring the
   requested zone.

   If an unauthorized client attempts to connect to the zoneserver,
   zoneserver immediately disconnects the unauthorized client.
