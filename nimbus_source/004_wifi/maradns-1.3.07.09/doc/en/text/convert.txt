            Converting from another DNS server to MaraDNS

   The procedure for converting from another DNS server to MaraDNS
   is as follows:

     * Make sure that the names of all zones that the other DNS
       server has are in one's mararc file.
     * Configure the other DNS server to allow the IP of the
       machine which will run MaraDNS to perform zone transfers.
     * Use the fetchzone client to transfer the zones over.

   Assuming that one needs to transfer the zones for example.com,
   maradns.org, and heaven.af.mil over, the procedure would be as
   follows:

     * Add the following lines to one's mararc file:

 csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"
 csv2["maradns.org."] = "db.maradns.org"
 csv2["heaven.af.mil."] = "db.heaven.af.mil"

     * By reading the documentation for the DNS server that one is
       currently running, set up the DNS server to allow zone
       transfers for exmaple.com, maradns.org, and heaven.af.mil
     * Run fetchzone three times. Assuming that the IP of the
       server currently running DNS is at the IP 127.0.0.1:

 cd /etc/maradns
 fetchzone example.com 127.0.0.1 > db.example.com
 fetchzone maradns.org 127.0.0.1 > db.maradns.org
 fetchzone heaven.af.mil 127.0.0.1 > db.heaven.af.mil

   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   If one is converting from another DNS server, it is probably
   best to have MaraDNS act in a strictly RFC-compliant manner. In
   particular, star records should probably be handled in the exact
   same manner described in section 4.3.3 of RFC1034, and MaraDNS
   should be configured to have full support for DNS over TCP.

   To make star record handling strictly RFC compliant, add the
   following line to the mararc configuration file:

     bind_star_handling = 1

   To give MaraDNS full DNS-over-TCP support, follow the directions
   in the dnstcp document.
