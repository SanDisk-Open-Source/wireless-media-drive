This guide is for experienced UNIX/Liunx/BSD users who just want to quickly
try out MaraDNS

       MaraDNS acts as both a recursive and an authoritative DNS server. In
       other words, MaraDNS can both be used to speed up the internet, and/or
       serve domains that you may have.

       To try out MaraDNS as a recursive nameserver is easy:

       * Compile MaraDNS. Type in './configure; make' in the top-level MaraDNS
         directory.  Note: No need to compile if you downloaded a binary RPM
         or Debian package.

       * Take the file server/maradns and place it in /usr/local/sbin

       * Take the file tools/duende and place it in /usr/local/sbin

       * Create an empty directory called /etc/maradns

       * Create a mararc file. This file only needs to be three lines long on
         systems with a /dev/urandom file, and four lines long on older
         operating systems without /dev/urandom

       Here is a sample mararc file:

            ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
            chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
            recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1"

       This mararc file says that MaraDNS will have the ip "127.0.0.1" (this
       is the bind_address), run from the directory /etc/maradns (the
       chroot_dir value), and only allow the ip "127.0.0.1" to make recursive
       queries (the recursive_acl value).

       * Place the mararc file in the location /etc/mararc on your system.

       * Run MaraDNS as a non-daemon:

              /usr/local/sbin/maradns

         Since MaraDNS needs to bind to a privileged port (port 53), it needs
         to start up running as root. MaraDNS is designed with security in
         mind, and will drop root privileges before being visible to the
         public internet.

       * Test MaraDNS in another window or virtual terminal

              dig @127.0.0.1 www.yahoo.com

       * In order to make the duende daemonizing tool usable, create a
         directory named /etc/maradns/logger/

              mkdir /etc/maradns/logger

       * If this works, make MaraDNS run as a daemon:

              /usr/local/sbin/duende /usr/local/sbin/maradns

         duende is a tool that daemonizes maradns; the daemonizer is a
         separate program.

       * If this all works, install MaraDNS:

              make install
       It is also possible to set up MaraDNS as both an authoritative and
       recursive name server with the same IP:

       * Here is the MaraRC file:

              ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
              chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
              recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1"
              csv2 = {}
              csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"

       * Have a zone file named db.example.com in the chroot_dir (/etc/maradns
         above) that looks like this:

         example.com. 10.1.2.3

         (Yes, experienced DNS admins, you can have SOA, NS, MX, SRV, and any
         other kind of DNS data stored in a csv2 zone file. Read the csv2 man
         page for details)

       * Recurisve queries will be resolved normally

       * Queries for example.com will resolve to 10.1.2.3

       * Any other name.example.com query will return a "this host does not
         exist" DNS reply.

       Look in doc (in particular, the tutorial), or read the relevant man
       pages for more information on how to set up MaraDNS.
