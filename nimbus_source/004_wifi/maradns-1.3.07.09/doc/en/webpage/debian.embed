<h2>A note for Debian users</h2>

First of all, I would like to point out that I really appreciate Debian
making a MaraDNS package available.  This package has increased the number
of MaraDNS users, and the Debian developers have given me feedback that
has improved MaraDNS.<p>

However, because of Debian's policies, their "Stable" version of MaraDNS
is usually an outdated version of MaraDNS containing bugs that I
have since fixed.  I do not support these outdated versions of MaraDNS,
and request that Debian users upgrade to the current stable version of
MaraDNS before sending me bug reports or asking for technical support.
Here is my guide for Debian users, telling them how to upgrade the
outdated version of MaraDNS Debian comes with:<ul>

<li>	MaraDNS 1.2 has been, since 1.2.12.04, a "bugfix only" branch, 
and no new features have been added to this version of MaraDNS.  

<li>	It is very easy to update the buggy version of MaraDNS 
that the Debian package comes with an updated MaraDNS.

<li> First, download the most recent stable version of MaraDNS from the 
<A href="download.html">MaraDNS download page</A> 
or from the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/maradns">Sourceforge
page</A>.

<li>	Next, unpack the MaraDNS tarball.  For example, if you 
downloaded the file "maradns-1.2.12.08.tar.bz2" (please only download
MaraDNS-1.2.12.08 if it is the current stable version, which it is at 
time of writing this document), type in this command:
<blockquote><tt>
	tar xvjf maradns-1.2.12.08.tar.bz2
</tt></blockquote>

<li>	Enter the maradns-1.2.12.<i>version</i> directory, where 
<i>version</i> is the bugfix revision number of the most current 1.2 
release of MaraDNS.

<li>	Compile MaraDNS 1.2.12.<i>version</i> with the following 
commands:

<blockquote><tt>
		./configure; make  
</tt></blockquote>

<li>	If the above fails, you may need to install the "gcc" and 
"libc6-dev" packages before being able to compile programs:

<blockquote><tt>
		sudo apt-get install gcc<br>
		sudo apt-get install libc6-dev
</tt></blockquote>

<li>	Once MaraDNS is compiled, make sure to stop the MaraDNS daemon:
	
<blockquote><tt>
		sudo /etc/init.d/maradns stop
</tt></blockquote>

<li>	Now, replace the outdated MaraDNS program that comes with 
Debian.  From the maradns-1.2.12.<i>version</i> directory, type in the 
following command:

<blockquote><tt>
		sudo cp server/maradns /usr/sbin/
</tt></blockquote>

<li>	Restart the MaraDNS daemon:

<blockquote><tt>
		sudo /etc/init.d/maradns start
</tt></blockquote>

</ul> At this point, your MaraDNS daemon is now the fully supported 
version of MaraDNS.  If you continue to have the bug or concern after 
upgrading to the latest 1.2 release, please let us know so we can begin 
to resolve the issue.
