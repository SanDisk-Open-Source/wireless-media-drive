# Example simplified mararc file.  
# This only shows a subset of MaraDNS' features needed to be an
# recursive name server.  Look at 
# doc/detailed/example_full_mararc for an example showing most of the features 
# that MaraDNS has.

# Note that any line starting with a '#' character is a comment, which 
# means the line is ignored by the MaraDNS parser.  Comments are used to
# put human-readable notes in the file.

# The address this DNS server runs on.  If you want to bind 
# to multiple addresses, separate them with a comma like this:
# "10.1.2.3, 10.1.2.4, 127.0.0.1"
ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
# The directory with all of the zone files
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"

# Recursive ACL: Who is allowd to perform recursive queries.  

# With the following line, anyone with an IP starting with the number
# "10" can perform recursive queries 
recursive_acl = "10.0.0.0/8"

# Some other examples, which we have commented out (placed a '#' in front
# of to disable)

# With the following line, anyone with an IP starting with the numbers
# "172.16" can perform recursive queries
#recursive_acl = "172.16.0.0/16"

# With the following line, anyone with an IP starting with the numbers
# "192.168.1" can perform recursive queries
#recursive_acl = "192.168.1.0/24"

# With the following line, anyone on the internet can perform recursive
# queries
#recursive_acl = "0.0.0.0/0"

# With the following line, both anyone with an IP starting with the number
# "10", and an ip starting with the numbers "172.16" can perform recursive
# queries
#recursive_acl = "172.16.0.0/0"
