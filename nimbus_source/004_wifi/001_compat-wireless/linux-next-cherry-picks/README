compat-wireless linux-next chery picked patches
===============================================

We work hard to get patches in time onto the stable
tree but sometimes a few things slip out, and sometimes a
stable fix is simply too big in size to be merged into
stable. In such cases though we do believe some of these
patches are still relatively important to either enable new
hardware which escaped the late rc cycles or to correct some
behaviour which might be too late for stable. We apply
these patches by default as they will be supported on these
releases.

The larger the number of patches you see in this directory
the more we should be ashamed. We should strive to reduce this
to 0 all the time.

This directory will always be empty for bleeding edge
releases as bleeding edge releases are always based on
linux-next already.
