compat-wireless linux-next-pending patches
==========================================

You must have a really good reason to be adding files
in this directory. The requirement is your patches must have
been posted to a public mailing list for the subsystem you are
working on. Each patch you add here must have a really good
explanation on the top of the file which clarifies why the
patch has not yet been merged OR specify it on the commit log
when you add it on compat-wireless.

We try to avoid having patch files because but we understand
if you might because you need to test code posted but not yet
merged into linux-next or a stable kernel release. This can happen
often during the merge window, when the maintainers are unavailable,
on vacation, suck at what they do, or for any other uncontrollable
reasons.
