compat-wireless crap patches
============================

If you are including patches into this directory you
must be fixing some critical bug for a customer which needs
immediate release or immediate testing.

Alternatively you would use this to apply some sort of
crap code you are maintaining.

You must have a really good reason to be adding files
in this directory. If possible you should explain your
reasoning of why the patch is getting included here and
not upstream and why it hasn't even yet been posted.

You should avoid these patches at all costs.
