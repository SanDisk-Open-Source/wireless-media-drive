compat-wireless pending-stable/ patches
=======================================

Often right before the merge window we get a block on non
oops/regression fixes for stable fixes. Some stable fixes
often get propagated afterwards during the extraversion
maintenance of the kernels. Right before the merge window
circa rc4 and rc5 subsystem maintainers get pegged if they
throw in non oops/regression fixes for Linus or their
respective upstream maintainer. While this makes sense
for tree management and stable release considerations we
still need to get users some stable patches propagated.

This directory is there to help with that. Only patches
which have been merged into linux-next.git will be included
in this directory which means you must post it and the maintainer
should have merged it and Stephen would have picked it up.

This directory will always be empty for bleeding edge
releases as bleeding edge releases are always based on
linux-next already. This directory only makes sense for
stable release of the kernel, and it we will always try
to use it, in case there are stable fixes not yet propagated.
