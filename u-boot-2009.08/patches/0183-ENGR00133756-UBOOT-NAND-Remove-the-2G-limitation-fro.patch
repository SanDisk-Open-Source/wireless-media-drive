Subject: [PATCH] ENGR00133756:UBOOT:NAND:Remove the 2G limitation from NAND driver

Remove the 2G limitation from NAND driver since currently kernel
can support more than 2GB NAND flash now. This commit will make
NAND driver rescan the whole NAND to create one BBT and store to
the last 4 blocks of the larger than 2GB NAND flash. This commit
will have no effect on the NAND which size is not larger than 2GB.
